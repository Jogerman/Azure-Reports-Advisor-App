## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (Version 1.0)
- ❌ Basic HTML/CSS styling
- ❌ Simple table layouts
- ❌ Limited visual hierarchy
- ❌ No interactive charts
- ❌ Generic color scheme
- ❌ Not responsive
- ❌ Minimal branding

### After (Version 2.0)
- ✅ Professional Azure branding
- ✅ Modern gradient backgrounds
- ✅ Clear visual hierarchy
- ✅ Interactive Chart.js visualizations
- ✅ Official Azure colors
- ✅ Fully responsive design
- ✅ Strong brand identity

---

## Known Limitations

### PDF Generation (WeasyPrint)
The following CSS properties are not supported in PDF generation and show warnings:
- `display: grid` (falls back to block layout)
- `backdrop-filter` (visual effect ignored)
- `box-shadow` with CSS variables (falls back to no shadow)
- `@media` queries (responsive breakpoints don't apply to PDF)

**Impact:** Minimal - PDFs still render professionally with Azure branding and colors. Charts are replaced with static images in PDF output.

### Chart.js in PDF
- Charts require JavaScript to render
- PDFs are static, so charts appear as placeholder images
- **Solution:** Future enhancement could generate chart images server-side for PDF inclusion

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Immediate
- [ ] Review sample reports with stakeholders
- [ ] Collect feedback on design and layout
- [ ] Adjust colors or spacing if needed
- [ ] Add client logos to cover page (if required)

### Short-term
- [ ] Generate server-side chart images for PDFs (using matplotlib or plotly)
- [ ] Add additional chart types (scatter, radar, etc.)
- [ ] Create executive summary report type
- [ ] Implement dark mode variant

### Long-term
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Custom branding per client
- [ ] Report scheduling and email delivery
- [ ] Interactive report builder UI
