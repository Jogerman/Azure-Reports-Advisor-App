## 3. Migration Execution Process

### Challenge Encountered
PostgreSQL connection authentication issue from Windows host to Docker container. The container uses `POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD: trust` but Django couldn't authenticate from the host machine.

### Solution Implemented
Created PowerShell scripts to execute migrations directly via `docker exec` with PostgreSQL commands:

1. **Script:** `run_migrations_docker.ps1`
   - Applied authentication migrations
   - Created client tables
   - Applied indexes
   - Registered migrations in django_migrations table

2. **Script:** `run_migrations_reports.ps1`
   - Created reports tables
   - Created recommendations table
   - Created template and share tables
   - Applied all indexes
   - Registered migrations

### Verification
All tables created successfully with proper:
- Primary keys (UUID)
- Foreign keys with appropriate ON DELETE behavior
- Indexes for performance
- Constraints (UNIQUE, NOT NULL)
- Default values
- Timestamps

---

## 4. Database Schema Verification

### Total Tables: 27

**Authentication:**
- `auth_user_extended` - Custom user model
- `auth_user_session` - Session tracking
- Django default tables (auth_group, auth_permission, etc.)

**Clients:**
- `clients` - Client/company information
- `client_contacts` - Multiple contacts per client
- `client_notes` - Internal notes and interactions

**Reports:**
- `reports` - Report generation tracking

- Django migrations table

### Foreign Key Relationships Verified

```

  ├─> Client (account_manager_id, created_by_id) [SET NULL]
  ├─> Report (created_by_id) [SET NULL]
  ├─> ClientNote (author_id) [CASCADE]
  └─> ReportShare (shared_by_id) [CASCADE]

Client

## 9. Known Issues and Resolutions

### Issue 1: PostgreSQL Authentication from Host
**Problem:** Could not connect to PostgreSQL from Windows host despite correct credentials.
**Root Cause:** Docker PostgreSQL configured with trust auth but Django connection failed from host (IPv6/IPv4 issue).
**Resolution:** Created PowerShell scripts to execute migrations via `docker exec` with direct PostgreSQL commands.
**Status:** Resolved. Migrations applied successfully.

### Issue 2: Migration File Naming
**Problem:** Django generated very long migration file names.
**Impact:** None, migrations work correctly.
**Note:** Keep file names for consistency with Django's auto-generation.

---

## 10. Next Steps (Post-Database Setup)

### Immediate Tasks:
1. **Test Admin Interface** - Access Django admin and verify all models are manageable
2. **Create Superuser** - Create admin account for testing
3. **Test CRUD Operations** - Verify create, read, update, delete for each model
4. **Test Relationships** - Verify foreign key relationships work correctly
5. **Test Constraints** - Verify unique constraints and validations

### Development Tasks (Milestone 2 Continuation):
1. Complete API endpoints for all models
2. Write unit tests for models (target: 85% coverage)
3. Write API tests for CRUD operations
4. Implement CSV processing service
5. Implement report generation service
