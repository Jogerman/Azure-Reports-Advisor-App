# Production Deployment Issue Resolution

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Status:** RESOLVED
**Time to Resolution:** ~45 minutes

## Critical Issue Summary

The Azure Advisor Reports backend application was experiencing a persistent `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psycopg2'` error in production, preventing the application from connecting to the PostgreSQL database and starting successfully.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Docker User Permissions

The Dockerfile used a multi-stage build with the following problematic pattern:

1. **Builder Stage:** Installed Python packages to `/root/.local` using `pip install --user`
2. **Runtime Stage:**
   - Copied packages from `/root/.local` to `/root/.local`
   - Created a non-root user (`appuser`)
   - Switched to `appuser` to run the application

**The Problem:** When the application ran as `appuser`, Python could not find the packages in `/root/.local` because they were in root's home directory and inaccessible to the non-root user.

### Secondary Issue: Azure Blob Storage Configuration

The production settings attempted to use Azure Blob Storage for static files, but the configuration was incomplete:
- Missing `AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER` environment variable
- Using the same storage backend for both static files and media files caused path validation errors

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Docker Multi-Stage Build (v1.0.4)

**File:** `D:\Code\Azure Reports\azure_advisor_reports\Dockerfile.prod`

**Changes:**
- Created non-root user with home directory BEFORE copying Python packages (`-m` flag)
- Copied packages to `/home/appuser/.local` instead of `/root/.local`
- Updated PATH to include `/home/appuser/.local/bin`
- Proper ownership using `--chown=appuser:appuser`

**Key Code Changes:**
```dockerfile
# BEFORE (Broken)
COPY --from=builder /root/.local /root/.local
RUN groupadd -r appuser && useradd -r -g appuser -u 1000 appuser
USER appuser
ENV PATH=/root/.local/bin:$PATH

# AFTER (Fixed)
RUN groupadd -r appuser && useradd -r -g appuser -u 1000 -m appuser
COPY --from=builder --chown=appuser:appuser /root/.local /home/appuser/.local
ENV PATH=/home/appuser/.local/bin:$PATH
USER appuser
```

### 2. Fixed Static Files Configuration (v1.0.5)

**File:** `D:\Code\Azure Reports\azure_advisor_reports\azure_advisor_reports\settings\production.py`

**Changes:**
- Use WhiteNoise for static files (more appropriate for Container Apps)
- Use Azure Blob Storage ONLY for media files (user uploads, reports)
- Separate storage backends for static vs media files

**Key Code Changes:**
```python
# BEFORE (Broken)
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'storages.backends.azure_storage.AzureStorage'
STATIC_URL = f'https://{AZURE_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{AZURE_CONTAINER}/static/'

# AFTER (Fixed)
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage'
STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'staticfiles'
STATIC_URL = '/static/'

# Media files still use Azure Blob Storage
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'storages.backends.azure_storage.AzureStorage'
AZURE_CONTAINER = config('AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER', default='media')
MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AZURE_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{AZURE_CONTAINER}/'
```

### 3. Added Missing Environment Variable

Added `AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER=static` environment variable to all three Container Apps:
- advisor-reports-backend
- advisor-reports-worker
- advisor-reports-beat

## Deployment Timeline

### v1.0.4 - Docker Permissions Fix
- **Build Time:** 2:51 minutes
- **Image:** `advisorreportsacr-afc0cmayd8hcekaf.azurecr.io/advisorreportsbackend:v1.0.4`
- **Result:** psycopg2 module now accessible, but static files collection failed

### v1.0.5 - Static Files Configuration Fix
- **Build Time:** 2:54 minutes
- **Image:** `advisorreportsacr-afc0cmayd8hcekaf.azurecr.io/advisorreportsbackend:v1.0.5`
- **Result:** Complete success - application fully operational

## Lessons Learned

### Docker Best Practices
1. **User Permission Management:** When using non-root users in Docker, ensure packages are installed in directories accessible to that user
2. **Multi-Stage Builds:** Carefully manage file ownership when copying between stages
3. **Home Directory Creation:** Always use `-m` flag with `useradd` to create home directory when needed

### Django Static Files in Container Apps
1. **WhiteNoise for Static Files:** More efficient and simpler than Azure Blob Storage for static assets
2. **Azure Blob Storage for Media:** Reserve blob storage for user-generated content that needs persistence
3. **Separate Storage Backends:** Use different backends for static vs media files to avoid path conflicts

### Container Apps Configuration
1. **Environment Variables:** Ensure all required environment variables are set before deployment
2. **Incremental Fixes:** Test and validate each fix independently rather than combining multiple changes
3. **Log Analysis:** Container Apps logs are essential for diagnosing startup issues

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
- Monitor application health and performance
- Verify all API endpoints are functioning
- Test report generation workflows
- Confirm Celery tasks are processing correctly

### Recommended Improvements
1. Add health checks for Celery workers in the health endpoint
2. Implement structured logging with correlation IDs

4. Create automated deployment tests
5. Set up alerts for container restart events

### Database Migrations
Note: The logs show "Your models in app(s): 'reports' have changes that are not yet reflected in a migration". This should be addressed in the next deployment:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations reports
python manage.py migrate
```
