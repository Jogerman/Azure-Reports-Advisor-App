## Issues Fixed During This Session

### 1. Settings Configuration ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Settings package __init__.py trying to import non-existent development.py
**Solution:** Updated __init__.py to use base.py instead
**Impact:** Tests can now run successfully

### 2. Cache Configuration ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Redis cache backend requires actual Redis instance
**Solution:** Added test-specific cache configuration using LocMemCache
**Impact:** All tests can run without Redis dependency

### 3. Test Fixtures ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** User creation missing `username` parameter (required by AbstractUser)
**Solution:** Added `username` parameter to all `create_user()` calls
**Impact:** User-dependent tests now pass

## Critical Gaps to 85% Coverage

### High-Impact Files (Quick Wins)

1. **views.py (184 uncovered lines)**
   - Status: Tests exist (62 comprehensive tests) but have import/setup errors
   - Action Needed: Fix remaining import issues
   - Expected Impact: +7-8% coverage

2. **validators.py (86 uncovered lines)**
   - Status: 0% coverage, no tests exist
   - Action Needed: Create test_validators.py
   - Estimated Effort: 1-2 hours
   - Expected Impact: +3% coverage

3. **generators/*.py (~200 uncovered lines total)**
   - Status: 0% coverage across 5 generator files
   - Action Needed: Create test_generators.py
   - Estimated Effort: 2-3 hours
   - Expected Impact: +7-8% coverage

4. **cache.py (104 uncovered lines)**
   - Status: 0% coverage
   - Action Needed: Create test_cache.py
   - Estimated Effort: 1 hour
   - Expected Impact: +4% coverage

5. **tasks.py (82 uncovered lines)**
   - Status: 14% coverage
   - Action Needed: Expand test_tasks.py
   - Estimated Effort: 1-2 hours
   - Expected Impact: +3% coverage

**Total Potential Impact:** +24-26% coverage (would reach ~75%)

## Recommendations

### To Reach 85% Coverage (Priority Order)

1. **P0 - Fix View Test Imports (30 min)**
   - Review and fix remaining import errors in test_views.py
   - Expected: +62 passing tests, +7% coverage

2. **P0 - Create Validator Tests (1-2 hours)**
   - Create apps/reports/tests/test_validators.py
   - Test all 86 lines of validation logic
   - Expected: +3% coverage

3. **P1 - Create Generator Tests (2-3 hours)**
   - Create apps/reports/tests/test_generators.py
   - Mock template rendering and PDF generation
   - Test all 5 generator classes
   - Expected: +7-8% coverage

4. **P1 - Create Cache Tests (1 hour)**
   - Create apps/reports/tests/test_cache.py
   - Test cache get/set/invalidate operations
   - Expected: +4% coverage

5. **P2 - Expand Task Tests (1-2 hours)**
   - Add more Celery task tests
   - Mock async operations
   - Expected: +3% coverage

**Total Estimated Time:** 6-9 hours
**Expected Final Coverage:** 75-85%
