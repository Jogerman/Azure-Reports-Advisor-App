## Rollback Procedures

### When to Rollback

**Rollback Decision Criteria:**

Rollback should be initiated if:
- Critical security vulnerability discovered
- Data corruption or data loss occurring
- Application completely unavailable for >30 minutes
- Error rate >20% for >15 minutes
- Database connection failures preventing all operations
- Unrecoverable application state

**Rollback Decision Authority:** Launch Lead or CTO

### Rollback Steps

**Step 1: Initiate Rollback (0-5 minutes)**
- [ ] Announce rollback decision to team (#production-launch)
- [ ] Notify users via in-app banner: "We're experiencing technical difficulties. The platform will be temporarily unavailable."
- [ ] Put application in maintenance mode

**Step 2: Stop Incoming Traffic (5-10 minutes)**
- [ ] Update Front Door routing to maintenance page
- [ ] Stop Celery workers to prevent processing
- [ ] Drain active sessions (if possible)

**Step 3: Restore Previous Version (10-30 minutes)**

**Option A: Redeploy Previous Version (Preferred)**
```powershell
# Rollback backend to previous deployment
az webapp deployment slot swap `
    --resource-group "rg-azure-advisor-reports-prod" `
    --name "app-advisor-backend-prod" `
    --slot staging `
    --target-slot production

# Rollback frontend to previous deployment
az webapp deployment slot swap `
    --resource-group "rg-azure-advisor-reports-prod" `
    --name "app-advisor-frontend-prod" `
    --slot staging `
    --target-slot production
```

**Option B: Rollback Database (if needed)**
```powershell
# Point-in-time restore (to time before issues)
az postgres flexible-server restore `
    --resource-group "rg-azure-advisor-reports-prod" `
    --name "psql-advisor-prod-restore" `
    --source-server "psql-advisor-prod" `
    --restore-time "2025-10-06T09:00:00Z"

# Update application to use restored database
# (Update connection string in App Service configuration)
```

**Step 4: Verify Rollback (30-45 minutes)**
- [ ] Run smoke tests against rolled-back version
- [ ] Verify database connectivity
- [ ] Verify application functionality
- [ ] Check for errors in Application Insights

**Step 5: Resume Operations (45-60 minutes)**
- [ ] Remove maintenance mode
- [ ] Restore Front Door routing to application
- [ ] Start Celery workers
- [ ] Monitor application for 30 minutes
- [ ] Notify users: "Service restored. We apologize for the inconvenience."

**Step 6: Post-Rollback Analysis (1-4 hours)**
- [ ] Document root cause of issues
- [ ] Create incident report
- [ ] Identify what went wrong
- [ ] Create action plan to prevent recurrence
- [ ] Schedule post-mortem meeting
- [ ] Update stakeholders
