#### [00:20-01:10] Key Metrics Cards
**Visual:** Zoom into each metric card sequentially

**Voiceover:**
"At the top, you'll see four key metrics. First is 'Total Recommendations' - this shows the sum of all active Azure Advisor recommendations across all your clients. In this example, we have 342 total recommendations, and the green up arrow with '12%' means that's 12% more than last month. An increasing number could mean new clients added, or new issues detected. A decreasing number - which would show a green down arrow - means recommendations are being resolved, which is great!

Next is 'Potential Savings' - this is the estimated monthly cost savings if all recommendations are implemented. Here we see $45,200 per month, which would be over half a million dollars annually. The 8% increase means we've identified more savings opportunities compared to last month.

The third metric is 'Active Clients' - the number of clients with active status. We have 12 active clients, stable from last month, shown by the sideways arrow.

Finally, 'Reports Generated This Month' shows we've created 28 reports so far this month, up 15% from last month. This helps track your team's productivity."

**On-Screen Text (0:50):**
```
Metric Arrows:
↑ = Increasing vs last month
↓ = Decreasing vs last month

#### [01:10-02:15] Category Distribution Chart
**Visual:** Pie chart with hover interactions

**Voiceover:**
"Below the metrics, you'll see the Category Distribution pie chart. This breaks down your recommendations by Azure Advisor category. There are five categories: Cost, shown in blue, represents cost optimization opportunities - things like right-sizing VMs or deleting unused resources. Security, in red, shows security vulnerabilities. Reliability, in green, is about high availability and disaster recovery. Operational Excellence, in purple, covers best practices and automation opportunities. And Performance, in yellow, is about speed and responsiveness optimizations.

Hover over any slice to see the exact count and percentage. In this example, Cost represents 35% of all recommendations with 120 items. Click on a slice, and you'll jump to a filtered view showing only those recommendations. This is great for focusing on one category at a time, like prioritizing all security fixes."

**On-Screen Text (1:45):**
```
Categories:
💰 Cost (35%) - Savings opportunities
🔒 Security (25%) - Vulnerabilities
🛡️ Reliability (20%) - Uptime

#### [02:15-03:15] Trend Chart
**Visual:** Line chart with time range selector

**Voiceover:**
"The Trend Chart shows how your recommendation count has changed over time. By default, it displays the last 30 days, but you can switch to 7 days for a weekly view, or 90 days for a quarterly perspective using these buttons at the top.

Let's analyze this trend. We started the month at around 280 recommendations, and we're now at 342. The gradual increase could indicate that new clients were added, or that Azure infrastructure has grown. An upward trend isn't necessarily bad - it depends on the context. If you're actively onboarding new clients, you'd expect this.

Ideally, for an established client base, you'd want to see a downward trend over time, indicating that recommendations are being implemented faster than new ones are discovered. Hover over any point on the line to see the exact count for that day. The summary stats below show the total, average, and peak values for the selected time range."

**On-Screen Text (2:50):**
```
Time Ranges:
• 7 days = Weekly operations

#### [00:30-02:00] API Authentication
**Visual:** Code editor with authentication examples

**Voiceover:**
"The platform provides a full RESTful API. All endpoints require authentication using JWT tokens. Here's how it works:

First, authenticate using your Azure AD credentials. You'll exchange your Azure AD access token for a platform JWT token. Here's a Python example using the requests library:

```python
import requests

# Step 1: Get Azure AD token (using msal library)
# [See documentation for full Azure AD setup]

# Step 2: Exchange for platform JWT
response = requests.post(
    'https://api.yourplatform.com/api/auth/login/',
    json={'access_token': azure_ad_token}
)
jwt_token = response.json()['access_token']

# Step 3: Use JWT for API calls
headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {jwt_token}'}
```

The JWT token expires after 1 hour. When it expires, use the refresh endpoint to get a new token without re-authenticating with Azure AD. Store your token securely - never commit it to Git or expose it in client-side code."

**On-Screen Text (1:30):**
```
API Authentication Flow:
1. Azure AD login
2. Exchange for JWT
3. Include in all requests
4. Refresh when expired
```

#### [02:00-04:00] Automating Report Generation
**Visual:** Code editor → Console output → Generated reports

**Voiceover:**
"Let's automate the entire report generation workflow. This Python script does everything: creates a client, uploads a CSV, generates a report, and downloads the PDF:

```python
import requests
import time

API_URL = 'https://api.yourplatform.com/api'
headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {jwt_token}'}

# Step 1: Create client
client_data = {
    'company_name': 'Automated Client Corp',
    'industry': 'technology',
    'contact_email': 'admin@automatedclient.com'
}
response = requests.post(
    f'{API_URL}/clients/',
    json=client_data,
    headers=headers
)
client_id = response.json()['id']
print(f'Client created: {client_id}')

# Step 2: Upload CSV
with open('advisor-export.csv', 'rb') as f:
    files = {'csv_file': f}
    data = {'client': client_id}
    response = requests.post(
        f'{API_URL}/reports/upload/',
        data=data,
        files=files,
        headers=headers
    )
report_id = response.json()['report_id']
print(f'CSV uploaded: {report_id}')

# Step 3: Generate report
generate_data = {
    'report_id': report_id,
    'report_type': 'executive'
}
response = requests.post(
    f'{API_URL}/reports/generate/',
    json=generate_data,
    headers=headers
)
task_id = response.json()['task_id']
print(f'Report generation started: {task_id}')

# Step 4: Poll for completion
while True:
    response = requests.get(
        f'{API_URL}/reports/{report_id}/status/',
        headers=headers
    )
    status = response.json()['status']
    print(f'Status: {status}')

    if status == 'completed':
        break
    elif status == 'failed':
        print('Error:', response.json()['error_message'])
        exit(1)

    time.sleep(10)  # Wait 10 seconds before checking again

# Step 5: Download report
response = requests.get(
    f'{API_URL}/reports/{report_id}/download/?format=pdf',
    headers=headers
)
with open(f'report-{report_id}.pdf', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(response.content)
print('Report downloaded successfully!')
```

You can schedule this script to run automatically using cron on Linux or Task Scheduler on Windows. For example, run it on the 1st of every month to generate reports for all your clients."

#### [04:00-05:30] Webhook Notifications
**Visual:** Webhook configuration UI → Slack notification

**Voiceover:**
"Instead of polling for report status, set up webhooks to receive real-time notifications. Go to Settings → Webhooks → Add Webhook. Enter your webhook URL - this could be a Slack webhook, Microsoft Teams, or your own custom endpoint. Select which events you want to receive: report completed, report failed, CSV uploaded, or new client added.

When a report completes, the platform will POST a JSON payload to your webhook URL. Here's an example payload:

```json
{
  'event': 'report.completed',
  'timestamp': '2025-10-05T14:30:00Z',
  'data': {
    'report_id': 'abc-123',
    'client_name': 'Contoso Corp',
    'report_type': 'executive',
    'download_url': 'https://...'
  }
}
```

You can verify the webhook signature to ensure it's genuinely from the platform. See the API documentation for signature verification code. This enables powerful integrations - for example, automatically posting to Slack when a report is ready, or triggering a Power Automate flow to email it to your client."

**On-Screen Text (5:00):**

#### [07:00-08:30] Batch Operations
**Visual:** Code editor → Console showing batch processing

**Voiceover:**
"If you manage many clients, batch operations save time. Here's a script that processes all clients at once:

```python
import requests
import os
from pathlib import Path

API_URL = 'https://api.yourplatform.com/api'
headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {jwt_token}'}
csv_folder = Path('./client-csvs')

# Get all clients
response = requests.get(f'{API_URL}/clients/', headers=headers)
clients = response.json()['results']

for client in clients:
    client_id = client['id']
    client_name = client['company_name']

    # Look for matching CSV file
    csv_file = csv_folder / f'{client_name.replace(' ', '_')}.csv'

    if not csv_file.exists():
        print(f'⚠️  No CSV for {client_name}, skipping...')
        continue

    # Upload and generate
    print(f'📤 Processing {client_name}...')

    with open(csv_file, 'rb') as f:
        files = {'csv_file': f}
        data = {'client': client_id}
        response = requests.post(
            f'{API_URL}/reports/upload/',
            data=data,
            files=files,
            headers=headers
        )

    report_id = response.json()['report_id']

    # Generate executive summary
    generate_data = {
        'report_id': report_id,
        'report_type': 'executive'
    }
    requests.post(
        f'{API_URL}/reports/generate/',
        json=generate_data,
        headers=headers
    )

    print(f'✅ Report queued for {client_name}')

print('🎉 All reports queued! Check dashboard for progress.')
```

Run this monthly to generate reports for your entire client portfolio in one command. You can even add error handling, logging, and email notifications for a production-ready solution."

#### [08:30-09:30] Advanced Dashboard Analytics API
**Visual:** Jupyter Notebook with data analysis

**Voiceover:**
"For data analysts, the Analytics API provides granular data for custom analysis. Fetch trend data and create your own visualizations:

```python
import requests
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Fetch 90-day trend data
response = requests.get(
    f'{API_URL}/analytics/trends/?days=90',
    headers=headers
)
trend_data = response.json()

# Convert to DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(trend_data['daily_data'])
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])

# Create visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(df['date'], df['count'], marker='o')
plt.title('Recommendations Trend (90 Days)')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.grid(True)
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('trend-analysis.png')
```

You can combine this with client performance data, cost savings over time, or category breakdowns. Export the data to Excel for sharing with stakeholders, or load it into your data warehouse for long-term analysis."

## Appendix: Script Writing Tips

### Best Practices

**Do:**
- ✅ Write conversationally (like you're helping a friend)
- ✅ Use active voice ("Click the button" not "The button is clicked")
- ✅ Include pauses with "..." in script
- ✅ Spell out acronyms first time: "REST API - that's Representational State Transfer"
- ✅ Use analogies for complex concepts
- ✅ Repeat important points in different ways
- ✅ Number steps clearly ("First, second, finally")

**Don't:**
- ❌ Use jargon without explanation
- ❌ Rush through complex sections
- ❌ Assume prior knowledge
- ❌ Read monotonously
- ❌ Overcomplicate simple tasks
- ❌ Skip error scenarios

### Voiceover Techniques

**Pacing:**
- Normal narration: 140-160 words per minute
- Technical sections: 120-130 wpm (slower)
- Intro/conclusion: 150-170 wpm (slightly faster, energetic)

**Tone:**
- **Instructional:** Confident, clear, helpful
- **Encouraging:** "Great! Now let's..." "Perfect!" "You've got this!"
- **Warning:** Serious but not alarming: "Important note..." "Be aware that..."

**Emphasis:**
- **Bold important actions:** "**Click** the Generate button"
- Pause before/after key points
- Vary pitch to maintain interest
- Smile while recording (it comes through in audio!)
