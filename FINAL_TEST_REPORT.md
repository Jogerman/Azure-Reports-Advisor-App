3. Verified response status: 200 OK

**Expected Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "results": [{
    "id": "xxx",
    "html_file": "reports/html/detailed_xxx.html",
    "pdf_file": "reports/pdf/detailed_xxx.pdf",
    "status": "completed"
  }]
}
```

**Results:**
- ✅ API returns 200 OK
- ✅ Buttons enable correctly (proving fields exist)
- ✅ Files download/open successfully (proving paths are correct)
- ✅ No 404 errors when accessing files
- ✅ No absolute paths (e.g., `/app/media/...`) causing issues

**Conclusion:** Backend serializer includes `html_file` and `pdf_file` fields with correct relative paths.

- ✅ Only standard MSAL authentication debug logs present

**Console Output:**
- INFO/DEBUG messages from MSAL authentication (normal)
- Success toast notifications
- No ERROR or WARNING messages related to reports

**Conclusion:** Application running without errors. All functionality working correctly.

## Fix Applied

### File Modified: `frontend/src/services/reportService.ts`

**Method:** `downloadFile(blob: Blob, filename: string)`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (Both HTML and PDF downloaded):
downloadFile(blob: Blob, filename: string): void {
  const url = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  const link = document.createElement('a');
  link.href = url;
  link.download = filename;  // ← Always downloads
  document.body.appendChild(link);
  link.click();
  document.body.removeChild(link);
  window.URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
}

// AFTER (HTML opens inline, PDF downloads):
downloadFile(blob: Blob, filename: string): void {
  const url = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  const isHtml = filename.toLowerCase().endsWith('.html');

  if (isHtml) {
    // HTML: Open in new tab for inline viewing
    window.open(url, '_blank');
    setTimeout(() => window.URL.revokeObjectURL(url), 1000);
  } else {
    // PDF: Download to disk
    const link = document.createElement('a');
    link.href = url;
    link.download = filename;
    document.body.appendChild(link);
    link.click();
    document.body.removeChild(link);
    window.URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
  }
}
```

**Impact:**
- HTML files: Now use `window.open(url, '_blank')` to open in new tab
- PDF files: Still use `link.download` to trigger download
- Single method handles both behaviors based on file extension

## Backend Fixes Verified

### 1. Serializer Fix ✅
- **File:** `azure_advisor_reports/apps/reports/serializers.py`
- **Change:** Added `html_file` and `pdf_file` to `ReportListSerializer`
- **Result:** Frontend receives file paths and enables buttons correctly

### 2. File Path Storage Fix ✅
- **File:** `azure_advisor_reports/apps/reports/services/report_generator.py`
- **Change:** Fixed absolute path bug, now stores relative paths
- **Result:** Paths stored as `reports/html/xxx.html` instead of `/app/media/reports/html/xxx.html`

### 3. Content-Disposition Headers ✅
- **File:** `azure_advisor_reports/apps/reports/views.py`
- **Change:** Different headers for HTML (inline) vs PDF (attachment)
- **Result:** Backend configured correctly for different behaviors

### 4. Database Migration ✅
- **Migration:** Applied to update existing report paths
- **Result:** Existing report now has correct relative paths
